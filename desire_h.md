To Helena:

H is a letter  
with so many meanings —   
heat from the hot tea,  
hit when he’s late to meet.  
Health across head to feet,  
and keep hope as a guarantee.  

Desire is a word   
stands for strong wishing —   
holding hands if wind’s blowing,   
hugging me when he’s suffering.   
Enjoying the sweetest apple,   
and lovely cheek nowhere to see.   

Desire H is a string   
connecting you and me.   
Even the Wi-Fi is weak or poor,   
powerful girl can always be sought.   
Believe one day dreaming is there,   
and even hearts will be odd.
